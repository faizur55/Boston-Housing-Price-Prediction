# Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project uses the classic Boston Housing dataset to build and evaluate a multivariable regression model for predicting house prices in 1970s Boston.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Google Colab

## 📈 Workflow
- Data cleaning and exploration (EDA)
- Visualization: displots, pairplots, jointplots
- Multivariable Linear Regression
- Log transformation for performance improvement
- Model evaluation: r² score, residual analysis
- Custom predictions using real feature combinations

## 🔍 Key Results
- Original model r² (train): 0.75 | (test): 0.67
- Log-transformed model r² (train): 0.79 | (test): 0.74
- Best estimate: Property worth ≈ $25,792 using log model

## 📁 Notebook
All steps are documented and visualized in a Jupyter/Colab notebook.
